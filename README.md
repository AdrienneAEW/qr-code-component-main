## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

That @import Sass will "gradually be phased out over the next few years, and eventually remove it from the language entirely...[It's suggested] that @use rule [be used] instead...but only Dart Sass currently supports @use. Users of other implementations must use the @import rule instead. 

This element while designed with multiple device sizes in mind, was able to be coded just once and manages to work and look good across practicaly all device sizes.

### Continued development

Time for me to go deep with Sass and use formula's and parameters in my global style book. Of course it depends on the challenge, however practice does make perfect. 

### Useful resources

- [Learn Sass](https://sass-lang.com/guide/) - This Sass guide was very effective for learning.
